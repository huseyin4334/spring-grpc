# gRPC Server
We will build a server that will listen on a port and respond to the client's requests.

We will build a server with these steps;
- Define the service, functions and messages in a proto file (greeting.proto)
- This proto file will be compiled with the `protoc` compiler and generate the client and server code. (by protoc-gen-grpc-java plugin)
   - For server: (GreetingServiceGrpc.java, GreetingServiceGrpc.GreetingServiceImplBase.java)
   - For client: (GreetingServiceGrpc.java, GreetingServiceGrpc.GreetingServiceBlockingStub.java)
   - These services will be implemented with `BindableService` interface.
   - This interface has a `bindService` method that returns the service definition.
   - This is a marker interface for the service implementation.
- Implement our service in a `@GrpcService` annotated class and extend the `*ImplBase` class. (Server)
  - We will `@Override` functions that defined in the proto file in the `@GrpcService` annotated class.
- Spring boot will automatically start the server and listen on the port.
- Also, add our implemented service to the server with `ServerBuilder`.

> A `stub` is a client-side representation of a service. It is used to make calls to the server. 
> `ImplBase` is a server-side representation of a service. It is used to implement the service.

# Let's Explain Some Concepts
## Netty Server
Netty is a NIO client server framework which enables quick and easy development of network applications such as protocol servers and clients. 
It greatly simplifies and streamlines network programming such as TCP and UDP socket server.

When we use `spring-grpc-spring-boot-starter`, it will automatically use Netty as the server.

## Server
When we write our services, we can use `@GrpcService` annotation to register our services to the server.
After that spring boot will start the server and listen on the port.

```java
import io.grpc.ServerBuilder;

@GrpcService
public class GreetingServiceImpl extends GreetingServiceGrpc.GreetingServiceImplBase {
    @Override
    public void greeting(GreetingRequest request, StreamObserver<GreetingResponse> responseObserver) {
        String greeting = "Hello " + request.getName();
        GreetingResponse response = GreetingResponse.newBuilder().setGreeting(greeting).build();
        responseObserver.onNext(response);
        responseObserver.onCompleted();
    }
}

// We won't add this. Spring boot will automatically start the server and listen on the port.
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Server server = ServerBuilder.forPort(9090)
            .addService(new GreetingServiceImpl()) // Spring trace the services and register them like this
            .build(); // After these, server is ready for listening

    server.start(); // Start the server
    
    // Shutdown the server when the JVM is shutting down (sigterm) (shutdown hook)
    Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> server.shutdown()));
    
    server.awaitTermination(); // Wait for the server to shut down
}
```

# Configuration
The properties for the server are all prefixed with `grpc.server`. and `grpc.server.security`. respectively.

> https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-spring/en/server/configuration.html

Also, we can configure with `GrpcServerConfigurer` interface.

# Server Interceptors
Server interceptors are used to intercept the incoming requests and outgoing responses.
We can use interceptors for logging, authentication, authorization, etc.

We can do it with 3 ways;
- `@GrpcGlobalServerInterceptor` annotation or create it with `GlobalServerInterceptorConfigurer` interface.
- List of interceptors in the `@GrpcService#interceptors` property or `@GrpcService#interceptorNames` property.
- Add interceptors to the server in `GrpcServerConfigurer` interface with `serverBuilder.intercept(...)` method.

# Exception Handling
We will implement `GrpcExceptionHandler` interface to handle exceptions globally. When we add it to application context, it will start to work.
It gets `Trowable` and returns `Status`.

# Events
We have some event types for the server; When changed the state of the server, these events will be triggered.
All events listen to the `GrpcServerLifecycle` interface change.
- GrpcServerLifecycleEvent 
  - This is the base class for all events.
- GrpcServerStartedEvent
  - This event is triggered when the server is started.
- GrpcServerStoppedEvent
  - This event is triggered when the server is stopped.
- GrpcServerShuttingDownEvent
  - This event is triggered when the server is shutting down.
- GrpcServerTerminatedEvent
  - This event is triggered when the server is terminated.
